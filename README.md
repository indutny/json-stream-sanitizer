Sanitize strings in JSON stream.

## Usage

```js
const Sanitizer = require('json-stream-sanitizer');

// First argument - pattern
// Second argument - replacement
// (Just as for `String.prototype.replace`)
const sanitizer = new Sanitizer(/bad-string/g, 'good-string');

sanitizer.pipe(process.stdout);

sanitizer.write('{\n');
sanitizer.write('  "bad-string": "value",\n');
sanitizer.write('  "other-string": "other-value"\n');
sanitizer.end('}');
```

Alternatively a custom "sanitize" function can be passed as the first argument
to the constructor:
```js
const sanitizer = new Sanitizer((string) => {
  return string.replace(/bad/g, 'good')
    .replace(/war/g, 'peace');
});
```

## Benchmarks
